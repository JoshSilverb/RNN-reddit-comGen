I'd say 95% of the shooting I have done was outside of the military. I'm certainly not at the Olympic level, far from it. Most guys shoot 58 rds a year. 18 to zero and 40 to qualify. But that never stopped any of them, especially the senior NCOs from taking shit or having low expectations from junior officers. Frankly I don't blame them, they were often correct. When I would zero one of the NCOs would come over to explain to me trigger squeeze, breathing and body position as we were walking out to check targets. When we finally got out to the target they'd see a quarter size grouping and remark ""Damn Sir!"". They would move on and often ask me to coach other Soldiers who were having difficulty. It's one of those things that earns you instant respect in the military.

189,karma_cats,0,AskReddit,33,3,1485389968,0,0,"I have no idea if this will help in your situation (as I work with kids who are mostly neurotypical and a little older than your son), but one of the most valuable techniques I‚Äôve learned for working with kids is to occasionally daydream with them instead of saying no. 

Here‚Äôs an example: Your son demands to go to the park. Instead of just trying to explain to him why you can‚Äôt, tell him that you wish you could go to the park, too, and ask him what he would do there if he could. Or ask him to design his dream park (you could even make a little art project out of it...and this might be too much to expect, but you MIGHT even be able to convince him to go off on his own for a little while and draw his dream park and tell you all about it when he‚Äôs done). This helps move you out of the role of the person who is always telling him no and let‚Äôs you have a positive shared moment together. Obviously you can‚Äôt do this every time, but you might luck out and get him to see it as a fun make believe game that he likes doing. 

Two other techniques that go along with this are (1) validating his emotions and (2) giving him acceptable options. 

(1) He probably doesn‚Äôt have a lot of vocabulary for his emotions at that age, so name the emotion and let him know it‚Äôs okay for him to have it. For example, ‚ÄúIt sounds like you‚Äôre really mad that you can‚Äôt do what you want to do. You know what? I feel the same way sometimes because there are things I wish I could do right now, but I can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs okay to feel mad sometimes.‚Äù This could lead into a discussion of ways for him to process his anger (for instance, ask him draw it). 

(2) Give him 2 choices of things he can do, and give him choices as often as possible throughout the day. So if you tell him that no, he can‚Äôt go to the park, after you guys process his feelings, offer two activities that he CAN do. Look for opportunities to give him choices: ‚ÄúDo you want to wear the blue shirt or the red shirt?‚Äù ‚ÄúWould you like to brush your teeth or wash your hands first?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you want to color or read a book right now?‚Äù Though there may be times when you get a tantrum because he wants to do neither, this gives you more times you can say yes to him and it also helps him feel like he has some say in what he gets to do. 

Two final things that may help: (1) try to notice when he‚Äôs being cooperative and praise him for it naming the specific action and giving him positive labels for himself to go with it (for example, ‚ÄúYou did a great job picking an activity we can do right now. That shows me that you‚Äôre really growing up.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúEven though you were upset that you couldn‚Äôt go to the park, you chose something else to do. It takes a strong person to get over disappointment.‚Äù‚Äîagain, I work with older kids, so you might need to sub in more 4-year-old friendly phrasing!), and (2) in a moment when he is being calm and cooperative make a list together of things he CAN do right now. Start of putting everything on the list that he mentions whether it‚Äôs reasonable or not (if he suggests a trip to the moon, go ahead and add it!). You put things on the list, too. Once you have a list that you feel like will produce at least 5 good options, go down the list one at a time and talk through them. (‚ÄúI wish we could go to the moon, but we don‚Äôt have any way to get there, so we‚Äôre going to have to cross that one off the list.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think cleaning my room is fun, but since you don‚Äôt like doing it, we‚Äôll cross it off the list.‚Äù) When you get a final list rewrite it and put it somewhere accessible and when he complains, let him choose something from the list he made.

I hope some of this helps!","My oldest son (4) and his autism. Love him more than life itself but Lord he's fucking infuriating and hard work, especially during the Lockdown period.

190,remnant_phoenix,0,AskReddit,10974,3,1554147995,1,0,"This is similar to what I came to rant about. My firstborn is 8; he has asperger's, ADHD, and disgraphia. I love him more than life, but SO much of the time (especially under weird circumstances like these) I don't LIKE him;  I don't like being around him; I find his company to be abrasive, disquieting, and overwhelming. He asks the same questions over and over and complains about how bored he is and acts like an entitled jerk to everyone when he cant have exactly what he wants and makes our home a distinctly unpleasant place for me to be a lot of the time. 

My 6 year old daughter is dyslexic. Neither want of them want to do their homeschool work generally, but the stir-crazy feel in the home makes it even harder, and my 8-year-old's mannerisms during this time encourage his sister to rebel even harder. 

My wife and I struggle with anxiety and depression; my depression has kicked up in a big way, which has my wife bearing more of the load which encourages her anxiety; these things definitely make it harder to handle special needs children.

194,erahwahh,0,AskReddit,9835,57,1489470931,0,0,"As someone who had a dad who could not wrap his head around the concept of an eating disorder, it took me *years* to realize that just because he didn‚Äôt understand it, it didn‚Äôt mean he didn‚Äôt care about me or my situation. He was one who tried to help by using the analogy that cars need gas to go, and you need food like cars need gas. At the time I was hurt by how insensitive he seemed, but by now I realized that it takes a special type of person who can immediately empathize/understand the damage that having an eating disorder can inflict. Even trained psychologists and medical professionals can be woefully insensitive to eating disorders, which is something I learned the hard way. The majority of people are DUMB when it comes to eating disorders. Like so dumb your jaw hits the floor at their responses. So dumb that they don‚Äôt even realize what they‚Äôre saying is hurtful because the only thing they know about EDs is that young girl stops eating so she can look like supermodel, much sad, just eat a burger. They don‚Äôt realize that this shit is oftentimes a perfect storm of several mental health issues that are comorbid to begin with and then they all mixed in just the right conditions to manifest into an ED. So it‚Äôs not as simple as eat something. it‚Äôs more like let‚Äôs get to the bottom of your OCD, PTSD, anxiety, depression, and whatever else you might have going on first! Then once that is on its way to being untangled is when recovery for an ED can be addressed. This is a lot for a regular person to understand, especially when it comes to something as instinctual as eating. That being said, it is still possible to be supportive of recovery/getting you through the day even if they don‚Äôt understand. This is not meant to be a free pass for them to be dicks and for you to just have to deal with it. 

If you are able to seek therapy or decide to in the future, I strongly recommend looking into the backgrounds of therapists if you are fortunate enough to have a selection to choose from. Usually ones that state that they work with young adults are a decent place to start if you can‚Äôt find one that specifically mentions that they work with eating disorder cases. You might be aware of this already, but anorexia has the highest mortality rate of any mental health disorder. If the ones you love are not able to take this seriously, I sincerely hope that you do. while I didn‚Äôt get close to death, I had the hair loss, a disturbingly low blood pressure & pulse, barely enough energy to walk let alone walk up stairs, and too much time wasted on letting my disorder consume every moment of my life for a decade, amongst many other problems from it.

I would suggest thinking about the ways you would like to be helped/responded to, and asking for that if/when you choose to share knowledge of your eating disorder with them. If all of those responses you‚Äôve listed are HELL NOs, what would the opposite of that look like? What could they say or do that would help you feel cared for? Even simply sharing that list of things that will *not* work for you might be helpful.

Let me tell you my experiences as a child. 

I didn't know it until I was 20, but my mom used the promise of contact with me and brother as a way to extort more child support from my dad. He couldn't afford it, so she kept us away from him. She would lie and tell him we didn't want to see him or talk to him, and she would lie to us and say he was a deadbeat and didn't want to see us. She would use the fact that we never saw him or that he refused to pay child support as ""proof"" that he didn't care about us and was living it up with his ""new family"". She made me believe I hated him for 10 years, that he abandoned us without a care in the world. And with all this poison she kept spouting, I really truly thought I hated him. It wasn't until a family tragedy brought him back into my life that I realized I didn't hate him, I just really missed him. After the initial tense meet up, we started building our relationship again and now I know how vindictive and cruel my mom can be.

Jokes on her, I have a better and much more meaningful relationship with my dad now than I do with her!

The only advice I can give is be patient, and don't try to villianize her mom like she's trying to do with your husband.  As his daughter gets older she'll start understanding what her mom is doing isn't right, or just may need a place to get away from her mom without judgement.

Let it happen naturally, you will be surprised how many issues, red flags or other things you would overlook if you're actively seeking a partner. This obviously won't work in every instance but it's how I have come to see things.  Everybody's experience and their response to it is different.
  

This comes from experience, no doubt it isn't as severe as yours. But i have been in relationships where i was put down and emotionally abused somewhat. As a result afterwards I would look for a partner and accept anybody who came even close to  what i wanted in a person because of my reduced percieved self worth. The relationships never lasted either via self sabotage or us just not being a suitable match.   
Then I decided to stop looking, to focus on me and learn to be happy with my own company. To improve myself from the inside out. I saw women that I would usually go for, but didn't. I saw friends who sought relationships like I did. I saw it play out from a different perspective.  
Part of me had given up hope, part of me thought that not everybody is suited to relationships. Then I met my now wife and everything worked out.  But I did learn that having a partner is not an essential tool to happiness, you have to find that in yourself.

227,whatsit111,0,AskReddit,6729,4,1552665464,0,0,"I've been here, and I *highly* recommend getting therapy if you can. 

You shouldn't think of yourself as undatable, but you almost certainly developed unhealthy strategies and thought patterns to help you cope with your last relationship that will undermine potential future relationships. You might recognize some of them, but there are probably some that are so normalized for you that you can't see them clearly, and if you can't see problems you can't fix them. Therapy can help you recognize and manage/work through them.

There's nothing wrong with being single, and I agree that it's absolutely better to be alone than in a bad relationship. But if there's any chance you'll be open to romantic love in the future (and I hope you're at least a little open to it), you need to work through the trauma from your ex now. Meeting Mr. Right won't magically make you comfortable being in a relationship or stop you from engaging in unhealthy or self-sabotaging behaviors, so you need to start working on these issues before you try to pursue relationships at all.

So yeah, working on this shit is important for developing the tools you need to approach a relationship in a healthy way if a promising partner comes along.

I played around with the idea of him getting possessed by Argent energy and being able to wield it via arm blades. It was definitely an over the top power fantasy but then again so is Doom so I don't see a problem with it. This whole process was accompanied by the amazing Doom 2016 OST of course.

719,__mifflin,0,AskReddit,32698,6,1545178232,0,1,"This is only tangentially related to your comment, but I think it's a fun idea so I'm sharing it anyway. First and foremost, however, please note that it's all just conjecture.

Consider two things:

* The universe is expanding

* Time marches onward in one direction for every point within the universe, so as long as the principle of uniformity holds true, time is moving forward everywhere.

Now, consider two things about black holes:

* Black holes have event horizons. And if a black hole becomes larger, the event horizon also stretches and expands.

* Within a black hole, each and every point is on a downward trajectory toward the center

So having said these things, I find it interesting to think about the possibility that our universe exists within/on the event horizon of a black hole:

* If we existed on that ""surface"" of the event horizon, the expansion of our universe could be thought of as a manifestation of the expansion of the black hole's event horizon.

* The dimension of ""time"", which appears to go only in one direction, is a manifestation of the inward-pulling gravity of the black hole.

* The faster you approach *c* in any direction, the more you alter your inward trajectory toward the center of the black hole. This is almost like special relativity. Not moving means you have a straightline trajectory toward the center, whereas moving at the speed of light means your ""orbital"" velocity has reached a point where it counteracts the inward pull of time/gravity of the black hole.

Again...this is just an idea more suited for a fantasy sci-fi novel than anything else. But I think it's interesting to think about.","The 100% truth: We really don't know.

Good explanation :) and to expand further on this, we basically can track time from the first fraction of a second after the Big Bang.  The problem is the further you go back in time, the universe becomes a smaller, hotter, denser place, and eventually it is *so* small, hot, and dense that our current laws of physics treat it like an infinity (also known in physics speak as a singularity).  We just can't really say what occurred before that moment.

Of course, we should also note that the ""until a fraction of a second"" bit is based on the assumption that the universe starts from a literal point that began expanding.  There's no way for us to know if it just chilled as not quite a point, or started expanding from a previous bounce of the universe, or a myriad of other things, because as I said, outside our laws of physics.","The 100% truth: We really don't know.

The lowest level of computer storage is a bit that can only have one of two values, 1 or 0 (on or off). Every type of computer storage is just a different method of storing series' of 1s and 0s. A hard drive contains one or more discs that have tracks full of indents that represent either a 1 or a 0. When you load an image from your computer, the read head on the hard drive finds where it is stored, then reads each but one at a time as the disc spins, until hundreds of bits compose the image. 


The read head doesnt see the image the way we do, all it knows is the 1s and 0s it has just read, and that it will have more to read, but as a user, we see them all at once appear on our screen as one complete image.
